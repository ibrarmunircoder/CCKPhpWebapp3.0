For Direct Current Fast Charging (DCFC) stations, engineers have several site design options based on desired charging performance, budget, and power availability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are three primary types of DCFC site architectures: all-in-one, split system, and battery-integrated. Each architecture has distinct advantages and disadvantages related to equipment costs, charging efficiency, and installation complexity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This article explores the differences between these three DCFC site architectures and identifies the scenarios where each is most suitable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>All-In-One</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>An all-in-one DCFC, as the name suggests, integrates the power modules within the same unit as the charging dispenser. This design is highly space-efficient, as it eliminates the need for separate power cabinets and rectifiers, which step up grid power and convert Alternating Current (AC) to Direct Current (DC). Additionally, all-in-one units are generally less expensive than other DCFC types.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the power output of an all-in-one DCFC is typically limited, usually ranging from 25-240 kW, depending on the manufacturer. Another drawback is the inability to share power across multiple units, limiting load management and site power optimization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Popular all-in-one DCFC models include the ABB Terra series, Tritium PKM150, and Autel MaxiCharger DC Fast. Prices start at approximately $50,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><cite>Advantages:</cite></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Lower cost</li>\r\n	<li>Compact station footprint</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Limited power output</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Inefficient power usage</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Reduced vehicle throughput</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Ideal Locations:</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Grocery stores</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Medium-duty fleet depots</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Urban parking garages</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Split System</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike all-in-one DCFCs, split system designs, also known as distributed systems, feature separate power cabinets and charging dispensers. While this configuration requires more space and is more expensive, it&rsquo;s ideal for sites that demand high charging performance and efficient power distribution across multiple dispensers through load management. Typically, one power cabinet can support up to four dispensers, modulating power to prevent overloading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A split system DCFC offers higher power output than all-in-one systems, with power cabinets capable of delivering up to 600 kW across multiple dispensers. Some models can even link multiple power cabinets to enhance power distribution efficiency, with the potential to provide over 350 kW per dispenser&mdash;currently the highest output for light-duty EVs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Split system DCFCs are commonly used for new installations, especially at highway rest stops or commercial sites. Notable models include the Chargepoint Express Plus, BTC Gen4 Split System, and Kempower Distributed DCFC. Prices start around $80,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Advantages:</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>High power output</li>\r\n	<li>Increased vehicle throughput</li>\r\n	<li>Efficient power usage</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Higher cost</li>\r\n	<li>Larger station footprint</li>\r\n	<li>Battery-Integrated</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The battery-integrated DCFC addresses a specific issue for site hosts: demand fees charged by electric utilities when power usage exceeds a certain threshold. These fees can be significant, especially for high-power DCFC sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By integrating a battery between the utility connection and the charging dispenser, site hosts can avoid these demand fees. The battery charges slowly, avoiding spikes in power usage, and then discharges to supply power to EVs during charging sessions. Another advantage is that this design can often be implemented without requiring costly electrical service upgrades, saving site hosts tens of thousands of dollars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the battery can be installed separately, a battery-integrated DCFC combines it with the charging unit, enlarging the footprint slightly compared to an all-in-one DCFC but requiring less space than a split system. However, these units are the most expensive among the three types, primarily due to the large battery pack. Once the battery is fully discharged, charging performance is limited to the grid connection, typically around 30 kW. Manufacturers claim battery-integrated DCFCs can charge up to 20 EVs per day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Battery packs in these units range from 160 kWh to 466 kWh, with outputs around 200 kW. Popular models include the Freewire Boost 200 and XCharge Net Zero Series. Prices start at approximately $170,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Advantages:</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Avoids utility demand fees</li>\r\n	<li>Compact station footprint</li>\r\n	<li>Eliminates the need for electrical service upgrades</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Most expensive option</li>\r\n	<li>Limited charging performance once the battery is depleted</li>\r\n	<li>Closing Thoughts</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interested in installing EV chargers at your property?

This new requirement is part of the broader updates to Part 11 of the Green Building Standards and aligns with California&rsquo;s aggressive EV goals, which include a push for only EV sales by 2035 and significant investments in EV infrastructure. With EV adoption rates in California already at 18%&mdash;compared to just 4% nationally&mdash;the state is leading the charge in EV readiness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The updated code seeks to install EV chargers at various property types, including apartments, shopping centers, and workplaces. Before delving into the specifics of these changes, it&rsquo;s important to understand key terms related to EV infrastructure, such as Automatic Load Management Systems (ALMS), EV Ready Spaces, and Level 2 Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Key EV Definitions in the California Building Code</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Automatic Load Management System (ALMS): A system that distributes electrical load across multiple EV chargers to manage power consumption effectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Electric Vehicle (EV): Any on-road vehicle primarily powered by an electric motor, including plug-in hybrids, but excluding off-road vehicles like golf carts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EV Capable Space: A parking space with the necessary electrical infrastructure to support future EV charging installations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EV Charger: Equipment used to charge an electric vehicle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EV Ready Space: A parking space with a branch circuit and necessary raceways to accommodate EV charging, terminating in a receptacle or charger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EV Charging Space (EV Space): A designated area intended for the future installation of EV charging equipment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EV Charging Station (EVCS): One or more EV spaces equipped with chargers, designed for vehicle charging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EV Supply Equipment (EVSE): The hardware and wiring necessary to transfer energy from the building&rsquo;s electrical system to the EV.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Level 2 EVSE: A 208/240-volt, 40-ampere branch circuit for EV charging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Low Power Level 2 EV Charging Receptacle: A 208/240-volt, 20-ampere branch circuit designed for EV charging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neighborhood Electric Vehicle (NEV): A low-speed, zero-emission vehicle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ZEV</strong>: A vehicle certified to zero-emission standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EV Charging Requirements in Residential Developments</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Significant changes have been made to Chapter 4 of the Residential Mandatory Measures. For large residential developments, EV chargers are now required in certain cases. For example, in multi-family or hotel projects with 20 or more units, 5% of parking spaces must include Level 2 chargers. Additionally, 10% of parking must be EV Capable, and 25% must be EV Ready, meaning they have 208/240V outlets for portable EV chargers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In total, 40% of parking spaces in large residential developments must have some form of EV charging infrastructure, a major increase from the previous requirement of 10% for EV Capable spaces. The code also introduces low-power EV charging for sites like apartments and hotels, where overnight vehicle dwell time makes this cost-effective. Low-power charging is cheaper than both Level 2 and DC Fast Charging options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EV Charging Requirements in Non-Residential Developments</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter Five of the Green Building Standard details the requirements for non-residential developments. For example, properties with 10-25 parking spaces must include several EV Capable spaces. Properties with 26 or more parking spaces are required to provide both EV Capable and EV chargers. For sites with over 200 parking spaces, 20% must be EV Capable, and 25% of those must be equipped with EV chargers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The code also allows the installation of a DC Fast Charger to substitute for five AC chargers, and includes provisions for medium and heavy-duty EV infrastructure at locations like warehouses and retail centers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Exceptions and Additional Notes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Certain projects are exempt from these regulations, as determined by the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ). The code also permits the use of ALMS to manage the overall electrical load from EV chargers, addressing concerns about the impact of EVs on the electrical grid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another key provision is that EV charging spaces now count as parking spaces in new developments, ensuring that developers don&rsquo;t lose parking capacity. However, once</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', '<p>installed, these spaces must be used exclusively for charging EVs, with penalties for non-compliance already being enforced by some jurisdictions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Unchanged Sections of the Code</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Accessibility requirements for public EV charging stations remain unchanged. Single-family homes are still only required to provide EV Capable spaces, leaving homeowners to make necessary electrical modifications for home charging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2022 California Building Code&rsquo;s EV charging requirements mark significant progress in supporting the state&rsquo;s EV adoption. By mandating chargers in new developments, more Californians will have access to the necessary infrastructure, accelerating the transition to electric vehicles. This update is particularly impactful for multi-unit developments (MUDs), ensuring that residents in new apartments or condos have convenient charging options. Over the next decade, these changes are expected to lead to thousands of new EV chargers across the state, further cementing California&rsquo;s leadership in the EV revolution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>=======================</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Case for Electric Cars with Less Than 200 Miles of Range</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most common questions about electric vehicles (EVs) is, &quot;How far can it go?&quot; A few years ago, this was a significant concern for many potential buyers. However, thanks to advancements in technology, many EVs today can easily exceed 250 miles on a single charge, with some models reaching 300, 400, or even 500 miles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fear of running out of power, known as range anxiety, is gradually diminishing among EV buyers. Modern electric vehicles are well-equipped to handle daily commutes, regional travel, and even the occasional road trip. This is due in part to the growing network of fast-charging stations across the country, provided by companies like Tesla and Electrify America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Improvements in battery technology and vehicle efficiency have led to longer ranges at lower costs. As the demand for EVs increases, investments in battery production have driven costs down even further. For instance, the 2011 Nissan Leaf, which cost $33,000 and had a range of 73 miles, now starts at $27,000 and offers 149 miles of range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, the cost of EV battery packs has dropped significantly over the years. According to Bloomberg NEF, prices have fallen from $684 per kWh in 2013 to $132 per kWh in 2021. Experts predict that these costs will continue to decline as the global shift toward electric vehicles continues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given these advancements, is it necessary for every EV to have a range of over 200 or 300 miles? We argue that a sub-200 mile range is not only acceptable but often desirable for many households. Here&rsquo;s why:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Average Commute is Under 40 Miles</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the average American commute is 39 miles. This means that any EV on the market today can easily cover the daily commute, even when accounting for factors like cold weather or high-speed driving. With gas prices at record highs, switching to an electric vehicle could be a smart financial move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Multi-Vehicle Households</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what about longer trips? For those who prefer not to rely on public fast-charging networks, a gas-powered car or a long-range EV can serve as the primary vehicle for long-distance travel, while a short-range EV can handle daily commuting and in-town errands. A 2018 report by KPMG found that 52% of American households have two or more vehicles, making it easier to incorporate a sub-200 mile range EV into the mix.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Affordable EVs Lead to Greater Adoption</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shorter-range EVs are typically less expensive because they require fewer batteries, making them more affordable for consumers. As a result, more households can make the switch to electric. Studies have shown that EVs are cheaper to own over time due to lower maintenance costs and higher energy efficiency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we want to increase EV adoption and reduce emissions, we need to focus on producing more affordable vehicles. This is especially important as car prices continue to rise due to limited supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Available Sub-200 Mile Range Electric Cars</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of available short-range EVs and their starting prices.

(2, 'EV Charging Feasibility Management', '2 (4).jpg', ' Consectetur adipisicing elit sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt...', '<h3>3 Types of DCFC Site Architecture</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Designing and engineering electric vehicle (EV) charging stations involves a complex set of tasks, with various manufacturers and system components needed to ensure safe and efficient charging. For Direct Current Fast Charging (DCFC) stations, engineers have several site design options based on desired charging performance, budget, and power availability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are three primary types of DCFC site architectures: all-in-one, split system, and battery-integrated. Each architecture has distinct advantages and disadvantages related to equipment costs, charging efficiency, and installation complexity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This article explores the differences between these three DCFC site architectures and identifies the scenarios where each is most suitable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>All-In-One</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>An all-in-one DCFC, as the name suggests, integrates the power modules within the same unit as the charging dispenser. This design is highly space-efficient, as it eliminates the need for separate power cabinets and rectifiers, which step up grid power and convert Alternating Current (AC) to Direct Current (DC). Additionally, all-in-one units are generally less expensive than other DCFC types.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the power output of an all-in-one DCFC is typically limited, usually ranging from 25-240 kW, depending on the manufacturer. Another drawback is the inability to share power across multiple units, limiting load management and site power optimization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Popular all-in-one DCFC models include the ABB Terra series, Tritium PKM150, and Autel MaxiCharger DC Fast. Prices start at approximately $50,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><cite>Advantages:</cite></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Lower cost</li>\r\n	<li>Compact station footprint</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Limited power output</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Inefficient power usage</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Reduced vehicle throughput</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Ideal Locations:</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Grocery stores</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Medium-duty fleet depots</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Urban parking garages</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Split System</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike all-in-one DCFCs, split system designs, also known as distributed systems, feature separate power cabinets and charging dispensers. While this configuration requires more space and is more expensive, it&rsquo;s ideal for sites that demand high charging performance and efficient power distribution across multiple dispensers through load management. Typically, one power cabinet can support up to four dispensers, modulating power to prevent overloading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A split system DCFC offers higher power output than all-in-one systems, with power cabinets capable of delivering up to 600 kW across multiple dispensers. Some models can even link multiple power cabinets to enhance power distribution efficiency, with the potential to provide over 350 kW per dispenser&mdash;currently the highest output for light-duty EVs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Split system DCFCs are commonly used for new installations, especially at highway rest stops or commercial sites. Notable models include the Chargepoint Express Plus, BTC Gen4 Split System, and Kempower Distributed DCFC. Prices start around $80,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Advantages:</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>High power output</li>\r\n	<li>Increased vehicle throughput</li>\r\n	<li>Efficient power usage</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Higher cost</li>\r\n	<li>Larger station footprint</li>\r\n	<li>Battery-Integrated</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The battery-integrated DCFC addresses a specific issue for site hosts: demand fees charged by electric utilities when power usage exceeds a certain threshold. These fees can be significant, especially for high-power DCFC sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By integrating a battery between the utility connection and the charging dispenser, site hosts can avoid these demand fees. The battery charges slowly, avoiding spikes in power usage, and then discharges to supply power to EVs during charging sessions. Another advantage is that this design can often be implemented without requiring costly electrical service upgrades, saving site hosts tens of thousands of dollars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the battery can be installed separately, a battery-integrated DCFC combines it with the charging unit, enlarging the footprint slightly compared to an all-in-one DCFC but requiring less space than a split system. However, these units are the most expensive among the three types, primarily due to the large battery pack. Once the battery is fully discharged, charging performance is limited to the grid connection, typically around 30 kW. Manufacturers claim battery-integrated DCFCs can charge up to 20 EVs per day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Battery packs in these units range from 160 kWh to 466 kWh, with outputs around 200 kW. Popular models include the Freewire Boost 200 and XCharge Net Zero Series. Prices start at approximately $170,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Advantages:</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Avoids utility demand fees</li>\r\n	<li>Compact station footprint</li>\r\n	<li>Eliminates the need for electrical service upgrades</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Most expensive option</li>\r\n	<li>Limited charging performance once the battery is depleted</li>\r\n	<li>Closing Thoughts</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interested in installing EV chargers at your property?

This new requirement is part of the broader updates to Part 11 of the Green Building Standards and aligns with California&rsquo;s aggressive EV goals, which include a push for only EV sales by 2035 and significant investments in EV infrastructure. With EV adoption rates in California already at 18%&mdash;compared to just 4% nationally&mdash;the state is leading the charge in EV readiness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The updated code seeks to install EV chargers at various property types, including apartments, shopping centers, and workplaces. Before delving into the specifics of these changes, it&rsquo;s important to understand key terms related to EV infrastructure, such as Automatic Load Management Systems (ALMS), EV Ready Spaces, and Level 2 Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Key EV Definitions in the California Building Code</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Automatic Load Management System (ALMS): A system that distributes electrical load across multiple EV chargers to manage power consumption effectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Electric Vehicle (EV): Any on-road vehicle primarily powered by an electric motor, including plug-in hybrids, but excluding off-road vehicles like golf carts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EV Capable Space: A parking space with the necessary electrical infrastructure to support future EV charging installations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EV Charger: Equipment used to charge an electric vehicle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EV Ready Space: A parking space with a branch circuit and necessary raceways to accommodate EV charging, terminating in a receptacle or charger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EV Charging Space (EV Space): A designated area intended for the future installation of EV charging equipment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EV Charging Station (EVCS): One or more EV spaces equipped with chargers, designed for vehicle charging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EV Supply Equipment (EVSE): The hardware and wiring necessary to transfer energy from the building&rsquo;s electrical system to the EV.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Level 2 EVSE: A 208/240-volt, 40-ampere branch circuit for EV charging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Low Power Level 2 EV Charging Receptacle: A 208/240-volt, 20-ampere branch circuit designed for EV charging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neighborhood Electric Vehicle (NEV): A low-speed, zero-emission vehicle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ZEV</strong>: A vehicle certified to zero-emission standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EV Charging Requirements in Residential Developments</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Significant changes have been made to Chapter 4 of the Residential Mandatory Measures. For large residential developments, EV chargers are now required in certain cases. For example, in multi-family or hotel projects with 20 or more units, 5% of parking spaces must include Level 2 chargers. Additionally, 10% of parking must be EV Capable, and 25% must be EV Ready, meaning they have 208/240V outlets for portable EV chargers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In total, 40% of parking spaces in large residential developments must have some form of EV charging infrastructure, a major increase from the previous requirement of 10% for EV Capable spaces. The code also introduces low-power EV charging for sites like apartments and hotels, where overnight vehicle dwell time makes this cost-effective. Low-power charging is cheaper than both Level 2 and DC Fast Charging options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EV Charging Requirements in Non-Residential Developments</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter Five of the Green Building Standard details the requirements for non-residential developments. For example, properties with 10-25 parking spaces must include several EV Capable spaces. Properties with 26 or more parking spaces are required to provide both EV Capable and EV chargers. For sites with over 200 parking spaces, 20% must be EV Capable, and 25% of those must be equipped with EV chargers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The code also allows the installation of a DC Fast Charger to substitute for five AC chargers, and includes provisions for medium and heavy-duty EV infrastructure at locations like warehouses and retail centers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Exceptions and Additional Notes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Certain projects are exempt from these regulations, as determined by the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ). The code also permits the use of ALMS to manage the overall electrical load from EV chargers, addressing concerns about the impact of EVs on the electrical grid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another key provision is that EV charging spaces now count as parking spaces in new developments, ensuring that developers don&rsquo;t lose parking capacity. However, once</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', '<p>installed, these spaces must be used exclusively for charging EVs, with penalties for non-compliance already being enforced by some jurisdictions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Unchanged Sections of the Code</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Accessibility requirements for public EV charging stations remain unchanged. Single-family homes are still only required to provide EV Capable spaces, leaving homeowners to make necessary electrical modifications for home charging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2022 California Building Code&rsquo;s EV charging requirements mark significant progress in supporting the state&rsquo;s EV adoption. By mandating chargers in new developments, more Californians will have access to the necessary infrastructure, accelerating the transition to electric vehicles. This update is particularly impactful for multi-unit developments (MUDs), ensuring that residents in new apartments or condos have convenient charging options. Over the next decade, these changes are expected to lead to thousands of new EV chargers across the state, further cementing California&rsquo;s leadership in the EV revolution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>=======================</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Case for Electric Cars with Less Than 200 Miles of Range</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most common questions about electric vehicles (EVs) is, &quot;How far can it go?&quot; A few years ago, this was a significant concern for many potential buyers. However, thanks to advancements in technology, many EVs today can easily exceed 250 miles on a single charge, with some models reaching 300, 400, or even 500 miles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fear of running out of power, known as range anxiety, is gradually diminishing among EV buyers. Modern electric vehicles are well-equipped to handle daily commutes, regional travel, and even the occasional road trip. This is due in part to the growing network of fast-charging stations across the country, provided by companies like Tesla and Electrify America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Improvements in battery technology and vehicle efficiency have led to longer ranges at lower costs. As the demand for EVs increases, investments in battery production have driven costs down even further. For instance, the 2011 Nissan Leaf, which cost $33,000 and had a range of 73 miles, now starts at $27,000 and offers 149 miles of range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, the cost of EV battery packs has dropped significantly over the years. According to Bloomberg NEF, prices have fallen from $684 per kWh in 2013 to $132 per kWh in 2021. Experts predict that these costs will continue to decline as the global shift toward electric vehicles continues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given these advancements, is it necessary for every EV to have a range of over 200 or 300 miles? We argue that a sub-200 mile range is not only acceptable but often desirable for many households. Here&rsquo;s why:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Average Commute is Under 40 Miles</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the average American commute is 39 miles. This means that any EV on the market today can easily cover the daily commute, even when accounting for factors like cold weather or high-speed driving. With gas prices at record highs, switching to an electric vehicle could be a smart financial move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Multi-Vehicle Households</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what about longer trips? For those who prefer not to rely on public fast-charging networks, a gas-powered car or a long-range EV can serve as the primary vehicle for long-distance travel, while a short-range EV can handle daily commuting and in-town errands. A 2018 report by KPMG found that 52% of American households have two or more vehicles, making it easier to incorporate a sub-200 mile range EV into the mix.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Affordable EVs Lead to Greater Adoption</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shorter-range EVs are typically less expensive because they require fewer batteries, making them more affordable for consumers. As a result, more households can make the switch to electric. Studies have shown that EVs are cheaper to own over time due to lower maintenance costs and higher energy efficiency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we want to increase EV adoption and reduce emissions, we need to focus on producing more affordable vehicles. This is especially important as car prices continue to rise due to limited supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Available Sub-200 Mile Range Electric Cars</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of available short-range EVs and their starting prices. After applying the federal tax credit, many of these vehicles cost around $20,000, making them a budget-friendly option for many households. This is particularly appealing considering that the average new car now sells for over $45,000. Additionally, state rebates, utility incentives, and local programs can further reduce the cost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vehicle Range Starting MSRP Cost After Federal Tax Credit</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mazda CX-30 EV 100 $33,470 $25,970</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mini Cooper SE 114 $29,990 $22,490</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nissan Leaf &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 149 $27,400 $19,900</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hyundai Ioniq Electric 170 $33,245 $25,475</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those interested in a used EV, many older models offer less than 200 miles of range.

Each architecture has distinct advantages and disadvantages related to equipment costs, charging efficiency, and installation complexity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This article explores the differences between these three DCFC site architectures and identifies the scenarios where each is most suitable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>All-In-One</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>An all-in-one DCFC, as the name suggests, integrates the power modules within the same unit as the charging dispenser. This design is highly space-efficient, as it eliminates the need for separate power cabinets and rectifiers, which step up grid power and convert Alternating Current (AC) to Direct Current (DC). Additionally, all-in-one units are generally less expensive than other DCFC types.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the power output of an all-in-one DCFC is typically limited, usually ranging from 25-240 kW, depending on the manufacturer. Another drawback is the inability to share power across multiple units, limiting load management and site power optimization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Popular all-in-one DCFC models include the ABB Terra series, Tritium PKM150, and Autel MaxiCharger DC Fast. Prices start at approximately $50,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><cite>Advantages:</cite></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Lower cost</li>\r\n	<li>Compact station footprint</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Limited power output</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Inefficient power usage</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Reduced vehicle throughput</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Ideal Locations:</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Grocery stores</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Medium-duty fleet depots</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Urban parking garages</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Split System</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike all-in-one DCFCs, split system designs, also known as distributed systems, feature separate power cabinets and charging dispensers. While this configuration requires more space and is more expensive, it&rsquo;s ideal for sites that demand high charging performance and efficient power distribution across multiple dispensers through load management. Typically, one power cabinet can support up to four dispensers, modulating power to prevent overloading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A split system DCFC offers higher power output than all-in-one systems, with power cabinets capable of delivering up to 600 kW across multiple dispensers. Some models can even link multiple power cabinets to enhance power distribution efficiency, with the potential to provide over 350 kW per dispenser&mdash;currently the highest output for light-duty EVs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Split system DCFCs are commonly used for new installations, especially at highway rest stops or commercial sites. Notable models include the Chargepoint Express Plus, BTC Gen4 Split System, and Kempower Distributed DCFC. Prices start around $80,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Advantages:</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>High power output</li>\r\n	<li>Increased vehicle throughput</li>\r\n	<li>Efficient power usage</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Higher cost</li>\r\n	<li>Larger station footprint</li>\r\n	<li>Battery-Integrated</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The battery-integrated DCFC addresses a specific issue for site hosts: demand fees charged by electric utilities when power usage exceeds a certain threshold. These fees can be significant, especially for high-power DCFC sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By integrating a battery between the utility connection and the charging dispenser, site hosts can avoid these demand fees. The battery charges slowly, avoiding spikes in power usage, and then discharges to supply power to EVs during charging sessions. Another advantage is that this design can often be implemented without requiring costly electrical service upgrades, saving site hosts tens of thousands of dollars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the battery can be installed separately, a battery-integrated DCFC combines it with the charging unit, enlarging the footprint slightly compared to an all-in-one DCFC but requiring less space than a split system. However, these units are the most expensive among the three types, primarily due to the large battery pack. Once the battery is fully discharged, charging performance is limited to the grid connection, typically around 30 kW. Manufacturers claim battery-integrated DCFCs can charge up to 20 EVs per day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Battery packs in these units range from 160 kWh to 466 kWh, with outputs around 200 kW. Popular models include the Freewire Boost 200 and XCharge Net Zero Series. Prices start at approximately $170,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Advantages:</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Avoids utility demand fees</li>\r\n	<li>Compact station footprint</li>\r\n	<li>Eliminates the need for electrical service upgrades</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Most expensive option</li>\r\n	<li>Limited charging performance once the battery is depleted</li>\r\n	<li>Closing Thoughts</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interested in installing EV chargers at your property?

This new requirement is part of the broader updates to Part 11 of the Green Building Standards and aligns with California&rsquo;s aggressive EV goals, which include a push for only EV sales by 2035 and significant investments in EV infrastructure. With EV adoption rates in California already at 18%&mdash;compared to just 4% nationally&mdash;the state is leading the charge in EV readiness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The updated code seeks to install EV chargers at various property types, including apartments, shopping centers, and workplaces. Before delving into the specifics of these changes, it&rsquo;s important to understand key terms related to EV infrastructure, such as Automatic Load Management Systems (ALMS), EV Ready Spaces, and Level 2 Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Key EV Definitions in the California Building Code</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Automatic Load Management System (ALMS): A system that distributes electrical load across multiple EV chargers to manage power consumption effectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Electric Vehicle (EV): Any on-road vehicle primarily powered by an electric motor, including plug-in hybrids, but excluding off-road vehicles like golf carts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EV Capable Space: A parking space with the necessary electrical infrastructure to support future EV charging installations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EV Charger: Equipment used to charge an electric vehicle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EV Ready Space: A parking space with a branch circuit and necessary raceways to accommodate EV charging, terminating in a receptacle or charger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EV Charging Space (EV Space): A designated area intended for the future installation of EV charging equipment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EV Charging Station (EVCS): One or more EV spaces equipped with chargers, designed for vehicle charging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EV Supply Equipment (EVSE): The hardware and wiring necessary to transfer energy from the building&rsquo;s electrical system to the EV.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Level 2 EVSE: A 208/240-volt, 40-ampere branch circuit for EV charging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Low Power Level 2 EV Charging Receptacle: A 208/240-volt, 20-ampere branch circuit designed for EV charging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neighborhood Electric Vehicle (NEV): A low-speed, zero-emission vehicle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ZEV</strong>: A vehicle certified to zero-emission standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EV Charging Requirements in Residential Developments</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Significant changes have been made to Chapter 4 of the Residential Mandatory Measures. For large residential developments, EV chargers are now required in certain cases. For example, in multi-family or hotel projects with 20 or more units, 5% of parking spaces must include Level 2 chargers. Additionally, 10% of parking must be EV Capable, and 25% must be EV Ready, meaning they have 208/240V outlets for portable EV chargers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In total, 40% of parking spaces in large residential developments must have some form of EV charging infrastructure, a major increase from the previous requirement of 10% for EV Capable spaces. The code also introduces low-power EV charging for sites like apartments and hotels, where overnight vehicle dwell time makes this cost-effective. Low-power charging is cheaper than both Level 2 and DC Fast Charging options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EV Charging Requirements in Non-Residential Developments</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter Five of the Green Building Standard details the requirements for non-residential developments. For example, properties with 10-25 parking spaces must include several EV Capable spaces. Properties with 26 or more parking spaces are required to provide both EV Capable and EV chargers. For sites with over 200 parking spaces, 20% must be EV Capable, and 25% of those must be equipped with EV chargers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The code also allows the installation of a DC Fast Charger to substitute for five AC chargers, and includes provisions for medium and heavy-duty EV infrastructure at locations like warehouses and retail centers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Exceptions and Additional Notes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Certain projects are exempt from these regulations, as determined by the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ). The code also permits the use of ALMS to manage the overall electrical load from EV chargers, addressing concerns about the impact of EVs on the electrical grid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another key provision is that EV charging spaces now count as parking spaces in new developments, ensuring that developers don&rsquo;t lose parking capacity. However, once</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', '<p>installed, these spaces must be used exclusively for charging EVs, with penalties for non-compliance already being enforced by some jurisdictions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Unchanged Sections of the Code</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Accessibility requirements for public EV charging stations remain unchanged. Single-family homes are still only required to provide EV Capable spaces, leaving homeowners to make necessary electrical modifications for home charging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2022 California Building Code&rsquo;s EV charging requirements mark significant progress in supporting the state&rsquo;s EV adoption. By mandating chargers in new developments, more Californians will have access to the necessary infrastructure, accelerating the transition to electric vehicles. This update is particularly impactful for multi-unit developments (MUDs), ensuring that residents in new apartments or condos have convenient charging options. Over the next decade, these changes are expected to lead to thousands of new EV chargers across the state, further cementing California&rsquo;s leadership in the EV revolution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>=======================</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Case for Electric Cars with Less Than 200 Miles of Range</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most common questions about electric vehicles (EVs) is, &quot;How far can it go?&quot; A few years ago, this was a significant concern for many potential buyers. However, thanks to advancements in technology, many EVs today can easily exceed 250 miles on a single charge, with some models reaching 300, 400, or even 500 miles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fear of running out of power, known as range anxiety, is gradually diminishing among EV buyers. Modern electric vehicles are well-equipped to handle daily commutes, regional travel, and even the occasional road trip. This is due in part to the growing network of fast-charging stations across the country, provided by companies like Tesla and Electrify America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Improvements in battery technology and vehicle efficiency have led to longer ranges at lower costs. As the demand for EVs increases, investments in battery production have driven costs down even further. For instance, the 2011 Nissan Leaf, which cost $33,000 and had a range of 73 miles, now starts at $27,000 and offers 149 miles of range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, the cost of EV battery packs has dropped significantly over the years. According to Bloomberg NEF, prices have fallen from $684 per kWh in 2013 to $132 per kWh in 2021. Experts predict that these costs will continue to decline as the global shift toward electric vehicles continues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given these advancements, is it necessary for every EV to have a range of over 200 or 300 miles? We argue that a sub-200 mile range is not only acceptable but often desirable for many households. Here&rsquo;s why:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Average Commute is Under 40 Miles</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the average American commute is 39 miles. This means that any EV on the market today can easily cover the daily commute, even when accounting for factors like cold weather or high-speed driving. With gas prices at record highs, switching to an electric vehicle could be a smart financial move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Multi-Vehicle Households</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what about longer trips? For those who prefer not to rely on public fast-charging networks, a gas-powered car or a long-range EV can serve as the primary vehicle for long-distance travel, while a short-range EV can handle daily commuting and in-town errands. A 2018 report by KPMG found that 52% of American households have two or more vehicles, making it easier to incorporate a sub-200 mile range EV into the mix.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Affordable EVs Lead to Greater Adoption</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shorter-range EVs are typically less expensive because they require fewer batteries, making them more affordable for consumers. As a result, more households can make the switch to electric. Studies have shown that EVs are cheaper to own over time due to lower maintenance costs and higher energy efficiency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we want to increase EV adoption and reduce emissions, we need to focus on producing more affordable vehicles. This is especially important as car prices continue to rise due to limited supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Available Sub-200 Mile Range Electric Cars</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of available short-range EVs and their starting prices. After applying the federal tax credit, many of these vehicles cost around $20,000, making them a budget-friendly option for many households. This is particularly appealing considering that the average new car now sells for over $45,000. Additionally, state rebates, utility incentives, and local programs can further reduce the cost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vehicle Range Starting MSRP Cost After Federal Tax Credit</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mazda CX-30 EV 100 $33,470 $25,970</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mini Cooper SE 114 $29,990 $22,490</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nissan Leaf &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 149 $27,400 $19,900</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hyundai Ioniq Electric 170 $33,245 $25,475</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those interested in a used EV, many older models offer less than 200 miles of range. These include vehicles like the Kia Soul EV, BMW i3, Toyota RAV4 EV, Mitsubishi i-MiEV, and Chevy Spark EV.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>============================</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How to Request EV Charging at Your Workplace</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Charging an electric vehicle (EV) overnight at home is the most convenient and cost-effective method. Similar to charging your phone, you wake up to a fully charged vehicle, ready for the day. Over 85% of EV drivers do this. However, the next best option is charging at your workplace, where your car is parked for long periods, making it ideal for recharging during the workday. If home charging isn&#39;t feasible for you, consider asking your employer to install EV charging stations. Here&#39;s how to approach the conversation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Assess Interest Among Colleagues</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strength in numbers is key when requesting workplace EV charging. If only a small percentage of employees are interested, the employer may not see it as a priority. However, if a significant portion, such as 20%, shows interest, the employer is more likely to consider the request. Talk to your colleagues to gauge their interest, even if they don&rsquo;t currently own an EV, as having charging stations could encourage them to make the switch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Develop a Detailed Plan</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before approaching your employer, prepare a comprehensive plan. This should include the estimated number of charging stations, potential locations, suggested vendors, contractors, and the permitting process. Anticipate the questions your employer might ask and address them in your plan. This proactive approach demonstrates your commitment and helps the employer assess the resources needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Estimate the Costs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your plan should include a cost estimate. Consider installation expenses, networking fees (if any), electricity costs, and potential rebates. Some companies may reduce costs by excluding networking or by passing electricity costs onto EV drivers. Having these figures ready will help you present a clear and informed proposal to your employer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Highlight the Benefits</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For your proposal to succeed, both you and your employer need to benefit. You gain convenient workplace charging, while your employer can retain current employees with EVs, attract new ones, and potentially generate revenue. Additionally, workplace charging can help meet green building standards and support a company EV fleet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Identify Decision-Makers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s crucial to know who the decision-makers are in your company. Ensure that your request reaches the appropriate individuals who can approve the project or are involved in the decision-making process. Maintaining close communication with these stakeholders will allow you to address concerns promptly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Lead the Initiative</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be prepared to take charge of the project if your employer approves it. Your employer may be reluctant to allocate additional resources, so your willingness to lead the project could be crucial. If your current workload doesn&rsquo;t allow this, consider hiring an EV charging consultant to manage the project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Follow Through on Your Commitment</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After making your request, it&rsquo;s essential to follow through. Whether providing more information or leading the project, meeting the expectations you set will build trust with your employer and increase the likelihood of a successful outcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Charging your EV at home or work significantly reduces the need for public charging stops, making your daily routine more convenient. Over 90% of your charging can be done at home or work. If you have further questions or need help with your workplace charging project, feel free to reach out to us.
